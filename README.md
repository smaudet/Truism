Truism
======

This aims to be a public repository of truth.

Goal
=====

To be the source of the best arguments, and to provide the best building blocks for new arguments.

Use
=====

This project was started as the result of two friends arguing. We decided it would be a better idea to let more people be able to access, modify, and improve our arguments, rather that simply let the banter be lost to the social archives of time.

As such, it is only a repository of words and documents at the moment.

It is hoped that in future it could become a visual program as well, allowing people to construct, inspect, and deconstruct the arguments of others.
